# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a user is eligible for a loan based on various parameters using data analysis techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following parameters:

- `loan_amount`: The amount of loan requested.
- `loan_term`: The duration of the loan in months.
- `cibil_score`: The credit score of the user.
- `residential_assets_value`: Value of residential assets owned by the user.
- `commercial_assets_value`: Value of commercial assets owned by the user.
- `luxury_assets_value`: Value of luxury assets owned by the user.
- `bank_asset_value`: Value of assets in the bank account of the user.
- `loan_status`: The status of the loan (1 for eligible, 0 for ineligible).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a user is eligible for a loan based on the provided parameters. We will explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, visualization, and then apply machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary and preprocess the data for modeling.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize relationships between variables to gain insights.
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning models for classification.
6. **Model Training**: Train the selected models on the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
9. **Final Model Selection**: Select the best-performing model for deployment.
10. **Deployment**: Deploy the final model for loan eligibility prediction.
